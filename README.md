# Assignment1Hello all! I must say that it took me quite a few minutes to realize that, when entering my GitHub password into RStudio, it does not visually track how many cases you type. This led me to wonder what I was doing wrong when attempting to  push a change/commit into GitHub. As you know by now, my name is Jay Jeffries. I have spoken in greater detail about my details in YellowDig, but I am a second year PhD student in the QQPM program of the  Educational Psychology department. While it seems like R and GitHub might fit in well with what the program name sounds like, I, surprisingly, have never utilized GitHub in this way. I have had other professors create wonderful and accessible textbooks into GitHub (like Dr. Vanderplas has), but I have never had to work with it in this fashion.
